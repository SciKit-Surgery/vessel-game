	Cut by holding the left mouse button, dragging the cursor over a vessel, then releasing!<br/>
	You can press the spacebar to pause at any time. <br/><br/>
   
   <u>How to play</u><br/>
   
	Cut the vessel which has two <b> black </b> ends. <br/>
	Don't be fooled by the others! You'll get a time penalty! <br/>
	The size of the camera will vary in each level. <br/>
	Try to solve each level as fast as you can, with the least instrument movement. <br/>
