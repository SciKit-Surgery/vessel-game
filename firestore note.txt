make sure to remove service keys on the version uploaded to github. Add relevant stuff to .gitignore.

and before uploading to google cloud, remove all the service key stuff in general- it's just for local testing. Cloud should be able to automatically access the database. See this link in case any further adjustment is needed: https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart

make sure to update dependencies before google cloud upload as well
