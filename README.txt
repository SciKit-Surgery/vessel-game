A repository for the Physics and Engineering in Medicine MSc Project
"A Serious Game To Investigate The Impact Of Restricted Field of View
in Keyhole Surgery" (2023).

Currently written to be opened in a local Flask server (for testing purposes) or run with app engine via google cloud at https://vessel-game.ew.r.appspot.com. Local/github version is usually most recent, as we want to limit large uploads to google cloud as much as possible.

This is the LOCAL version, not what's hosted on google cloud. This version requires service account credentials.  

Final version will be used to gather data for investigation of 
effects of field of view on laparoscopy.
